## Overview

The Evil Cirle with Bouncing Balls
We wanted to make it more interactive by adding a user-controlled evil circle, which will eat the balls if it catches them. we create a generic Shape() object that our balls and evil circle can inherit from. Then we added a score counter to track the number of balls left to capture.

How to Run the Code:
1: Clone the repository into an IDE of your choice. Find the clone your repository button or copy and paste the repository link into the space for the url. Then find a place in your system to stored the copied repo. 

2: Open the folder and display the project. You will see all files accompanying the project. You'll want to click on the one with the .html extension. Once that is open in your window, and assuming that you have Live Preview installed (*instructions for Live Preview at the end) Click the split rectangle with a little magnifying glass on it in the upper right corner to the left of the ... . This will open your Live Preview to view the website created.

3: For the full effect of the design, please click on the three horizontal lines in the upper left hand corner of the screen and you'll find an open in browser option. Click on that to open the full website in your browser for review. Or you can open your viewing screen to its maximum width on your screen.

*Search for the Live Preview feature in the extensions area of your IDE. Search for Live Preview and if not installed, install. Then to use either open it as laid out above or go to your view button and hit the command palette. Here you can search for Live Preview and click on it to start it up.
